# Detecting Fraud in Online E-Commerce Transactions

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data

In this project, I predict the probability that an online e-commerce transaction is fraudulent. I analyze data, engineer features, and compare several classifiers to select the best model.

The goal is to improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts, helping businesses reduce their fraud loss and improve customer satisfaction.

Topics:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering (including Principal Component Analysis (PCA))
- Class imbalance techniques (Random Undersampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE))
- Model selection and tuning (Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, GridSearchCV)
- Model evaluation (Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC AUC))

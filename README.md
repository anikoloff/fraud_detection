# Detecting Fraud in Online E-Commerce Transactions

The goal of this project is to predict the probability that an online e-commerce transaction is fraudulent.

I compare and tune several classifiers to select the best model, which can improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts, helping businesses reduce their fraud loss and improve customer satisfaction.

Topics:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering (including Principal Component Analysis (PCA))
- Class Imbalance techniques (Random Undersampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE))
- Model selection and tuning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, GridSearchCV)
- Model evaluation (Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC AUC))
